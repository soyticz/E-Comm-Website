HTTPS: All communication between users and the server is encrypted using HTTPS.
CSRF Protection: Measures are in place to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
SQL Injection Prevention: The application uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Performance Considerations
Lazy Loading: Products and images are loaded asynchronously to reduce initial page load time.
Caching: Popular product listings and categories are cached to reduce repeated database queries.
Optimized Assets: All assets (CSS, JS, images) are minified and compressed for faster loading times.
